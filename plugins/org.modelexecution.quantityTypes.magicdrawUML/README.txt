* File QuantityTypes.mdzip contains a module that can be imported by any MagicDraw 
project, and provides the full set of UML classes that define the SI Units (base 
and derived), the UReal class with the UML specification of Uncertain Real, and 
the Quantity class and all its associated Dimensions -- both base (Length, Mass, 
Time, etc.) and derived (LinearVelocity, Force, etc.)

* File ToyCarModel.mdzip contains the "ToyCar" example in UML. It makes use of the 
QuantityTypes module.

It makes use of the QuantityTypes module. This file also includes the "ToyCar" example models.

* File Quantities-IST18-v3.mdzip contains the models used in the IST paper (version 3) for 
sections 3 and 4. More precisely, the Figs 5 (domain model), 6 (units) and 7 (kernel). 
It also includes other figures that we did not include in the paper, such as one example 
that illustrates how the domain model is used to specify one case study.
